# MERGE SORTING
## Context setting
Unit 4 -> Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries -> Illustrative Programs
* It is very important to use a data type in a real-world case, to understand its true value and benefit.

* We are covering three types of sorts

      * Comparison Algorithms - Insertion Sort and Selection Sort
      * Divide and Conquer Algorithms - Merge Sort, Quick Sort

* We have already seen the power of Lists when we covered Insertion sort and Selection Sort 
    
    * Insertion sort 
         * Select a value from the unsorted sub-list
         * Decide where to insert it in the already_sorted sub-list
         * Right shift all the values and then insert the value
    * Selection sort
         * Set the first element as current element
         * Select the minimum value from unsorted list 
         * Exchange with current element
